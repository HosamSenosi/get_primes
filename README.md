# get_primes

Generating prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in a range of 2 boundaries, and a performance comparison.

## Features

- Fast prime number generation using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm (learn about it [here](https://youtu.be/klcIklsWzrY?si=teFrp_IluTcbb5bU))
- Optional Progress tracking during generation (in get_primes.py)
- Performance comparison with another implementation I used to implement
- Automatic file output for large result sets (more than 100)
- Execution time measurement

## File Descriptions

- `get_primes.py`: Main implementation using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
- `compare_performance.py`: Performance comparison between 2 different implementations

## Large Number Handling

For ranges that generate more than 100 prime numbers, results are automatically saved to a text file named `primes_from_[min]_to_[max].txt`.
